# WALMART-SALES-DATA

How do major holidays and promotional markdowns impact the bottom line across diverse geographic regions? This project analyzes data from 45 Walmart locations to solve a classic forecasting puzzle: predicting departmental sales amidst high-impact variables.

By dissecting customer purchasing patterns and the fluctuating success of specific product lines, I’ve mapped out the sales trends that define Walmart's market dominance. This analysis provides a blueprint for refining inventory strategies and maximizing revenue during the retail industry's most challenging peak periods.
